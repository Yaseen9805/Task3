Task 3 focuses on creating a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox. The aim of this task was to replace older layout techniques and understand how modern layout systems work in real projects.

In this task, I identified parts of the page that required alignment, such as the navigation bar, skills lists, and project cards. I removed inline layout methods and applied Flexbox to parent containers to control layout in a cleaner and more scalable way.

Flexbox was used to create a horizontal navigation bar that automatically adjusts based on screen size. Project cards were aligned in rows using Flexbox and allowed to wrap onto the next line on smaller screens. Consistent widths were applied to the cards so Flexbox could align them properly.

Properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and flex-wrap were used to control positioning and responsiveness. Browser developer tools were used to inspect elements, test spacing, and verify responsive behavior by resizing the window.

This task helped me understand how Flexbox works at the container level, how child elements respond to layout rules, and how to build responsive layouts without using inline styles or fixed positioning.
